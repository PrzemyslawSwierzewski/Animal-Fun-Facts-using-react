# Animal Fun Facts using react 

  This repository was created with codecademy to learn React.
  
# The purpose of the app

  My program will display a selection of animals on the screen. We’ll be allowed to decide if we want to include a background or not.
  Clicking an animal will cause a fact to be randomly selected from a list of potential options. The selected fact will pop up on the screen.
  As we keep clicking, we’ll be able to see different facts.
  
# What i learned while coding this app
