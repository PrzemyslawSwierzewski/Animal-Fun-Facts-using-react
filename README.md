# Animal Fun Facts using react 

  This repository was created with codecademy to learn React.
  
# The purpose of the app

  My program will display a selection of animals on the screen. We’ll be allowed to decide if we want to include a background or not.
  Clicking an animal will cause a fact to be randomly selected from a list of potential options. The selected fact will pop up on the screen.
  As we keep clicking, we’ll be able to see different facts.
  
# What i learned while coding this app

  To complete this project i learned how to render react on the page and how the JSX works.

You can see the deployment of the app by github pages

# My work

Everything that i write in this exercise is in the app.js. Like the function displayFact(that displaying a random fact), for loop (adding an array to images variable),
setting the background image to div #background, if the title variable is empty then the string "Click an animal for a fun fact" will be shown.
