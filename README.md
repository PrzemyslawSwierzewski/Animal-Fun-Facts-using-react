# Animal-Fun-Facts-with-codecademy-using-react
This project was created with codecademy using react.
To complete this project i learned how to render react on the page and how the JSX works.
My program will display a selection of animals on the screen. We’ll be allowed to decide if we want to include a background or not.
Clicking an animal will cause a fact to be randomly selected from a list of potential options. The selected fact will pop up on the screen.
As we keep clicking, we’ll be able to see different facts.
